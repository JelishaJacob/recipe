    <p>This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham. It is a favorite at Easter. The egg whites
        add a touch of lightness to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups cubed bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your
                beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl. Stir in the pineapple and bread.
                Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
